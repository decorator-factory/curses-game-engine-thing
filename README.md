# `curses-game-engine-thing`

Why hello there! This is a very dirty demo where I explored making simple games with curses.

Your game is more or less decoupled from curses, so theoretically you can connect it to a WebSockets frontend or something like that.
I might do that in the future, but no promises.

I am planning to clean this up soon!
